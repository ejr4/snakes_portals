# Snakes & Portals
### (name may change)

## Frameworks
### Phaser 3 / javascript 

## Gameplay 

Good old-fashioned Snakes & Ladders meets lemmings with numbered portals.

It is a puzzle game rather than based on luck.

Multiplicative* relationships between numbers are explored through gameplay: no 'math questions' are presented formally. 

*(for now, possibly with division, addition, subtraction in the future)

The on-screen characters move automatically.

The player's role is to strategically place 'portals' which send the characters to a new square which is a function of the number on the existing square.
