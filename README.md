# Snakes & Portals
### (name may change)

## Frameworks
# Phaser 3

## Gameplay 

### Good old-fashioned Snakes & Ladders meets lemmings with numbered portals.
### It is a puzzle game rather than based on luck
### *Multiplicative relationships between numbers are explored through gameplay: no 'math questions' are presented formally. 
### *(for now, possibly with division, addition, subtraction in the future)

### The on-screen characters move automatically
### Player's role is to strategically place 'portals' which send the characters to a new square which is a function of the number on the existing square
